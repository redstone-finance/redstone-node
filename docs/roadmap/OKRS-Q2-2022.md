# Redstone Oracles OKRs Q2 / 2022

## Basic goals

### Even more production ready - HIGH
- Run several nodes for production data feeds (at least 20 for each)
- At least 5 external node operators (maybe our investors or partners) to run our nodes
- Implement on-chain aggregation in evm-connector
- Token with basic staking (without disputes)

### Monitoring and stability - HIGH
- Regular manual checks, logs analysis, code cleaning
- More channels for important events (discord, telegram, sms)

### Custom Data Feeds - HIGH
- Create a basic fetcher for custom urls
- UI to set up a custom data feed
- Prepare basic docs and example tutorial
- [Maybe] create a quick and scalable version, where a user can query an api through proxy layer (it has some advantagesâ€¦)

### Educating external developers about RedStone - MIDDLE
- Fine tuning our docs
- Move all links and oracle docs to a single place (try docusaurus for this)
- Get feedback from at least 20 different devs
- Workshops and conferences
- Review our landing page

### Security - MIDDLE
- Refactoring core parts (redstone-node and redstone-evm-connector)
- Smart Contracts audits (personal audits, Code4rena)

### Growth - MIDDLE
- Team growth (new employees, 1 new marketing spec and 1 new dev, >=2 new community managers on discord)
- Business growth (new partners and customers, maintain a list of current partners in pipeline)
- Community growth (twitter followers, discord members, TT - 5K, Discord - 1K)

## Stretch targets

### Even more production ready
- Dispute resolution contracts
- Completed Smart Contract Audits (again :))

### Monitoring
- UI for nodes stability stats (with charts and time range selection)
- Integration with uptime-kuma

### Security
- JS Codebase review

### Offchain aggregation - MIDDLE
- Implement offchain aggregation (or reuse ready implementation provided by other projects)
- Set up an oracle for LayerZero
- [Maybe] implement SmartWeave based aggregation (for oracles)
